# Friday Mix

- Install Docker
- Clone repository
- Copy `.env.example` to `.env` 
- Run `./vendor/bin/sail up -d`
- `npm run build` to build assets
- Create app via https://developer.spotify.com/dashboard/applications
- Fill out `SPOTIFY_CLIENT_ID` and `SPOTIFY_CLIENT_SECRET` in `.env`
- Think initially it might be broke, got to `/settings` and add a user name and start time.
- Playlists in spotify need to be public
